 <h1>My Top 4 Movies Of All Time!</h1>
 <h2>According to luke</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Spirited away</h3>
 <p>Studio Gibly is one of my favorite movie companys. they have beautiful drawings and the animation is really good even with the intage styles.</p>
 <h3>The black phone</h3>
 <p>the black phone is one of my favorite movies because while being a horror movie it isnt that scary at all. the story behind it is very interesting. that being that most horror movies in my opinion dont have that interesting of a story</p>
 <h3>Dont worry darling</h3>
 <p>Being so far down on the list may make it seem like it isnt a great movie but dont worry darling is probably my most enjoyed movie that i have ever watched. ive seen it maybe 3 or 4 times and i enjoyed watching it every single time. The placement of the story and the drawn out explination of why the things that are happening are happening is absolutely amazing. i would highly recommend watching it</p>
 <h3>Nerve</h3>
 <p>Nerve is a really good movie, i think this because the people in it are polar opposites of eachother and the story is really interesting to me. Someone made an app and it gives people all over the world challenges to complete for a prize. Being that this is a web development course that movie was part of the inspiration of me wanting to start this cause i find the development of apps and/or websites to be incradibly interesting</p>
